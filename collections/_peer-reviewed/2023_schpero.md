In this cross-sectional study, we describe the prevalence of procedural denials of coverage in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) across states in 2019, before the pause on redeterminations. We also evaluate the association between rates of procedural denials and states’ renewal processes to determine whether states’ upstream operational investments may protect against high denial rates.
