The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care has long documented widespread variations in use of effective care. In its 2003 landmark study on the quality of health care in the United States, the RAND Corporation found that just over half of Americans received recommended preventive care, acute care, and care for chronic conditions.

Needed attention is now being paid to use of ineffective—or low-value—care, a form of overtreatment. While definitions vary, “low-value care” most often refers to medical services, including tests and procedures, that should not be performed given their potential for harm or the existence of comparably effective and often less expensive alternatives. Spending on overtreatment amounted to between $158 and $226 billion in 2011 and is estimated to be one of the biggest contributors to waste in the US health care system, second only to administrative complexity. Reducing the use of low-value care is particularly appealing given the opportunity it represents to both lower costs and increase quality. Before low-value care can be reduced, however, it must be identified and described.
