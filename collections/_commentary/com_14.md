In a new survey of leading health care policy scholars conducted by the Cornell Health Policy Center, more than three quarters of respondents felt that the Medicaid work requirements introduced by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) would do little to increase employment rates and that many people who lose coverage will do so because of difficulties submitting documentation, not because they are unemployed. Most experts said that the Congressional Budget Officeâ€™s estimate of Medicaid coverage losses related to OBBBA work requirements (5.3 million people by 2034) was likely to be correct. Although there was considerable consensus, some experts noted that their projections were based on evidence from work requirements introduced by Arkansas in 2018, which may not generalize to the current policy or to the rest of the country.
