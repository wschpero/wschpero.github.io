The Medicaid program currently enrolls over 86 million people, making it the single largest payer for health care services in the United States. Medicaid spending represents 16% of national health expenditures and, on average, 20% of state budgets. Medicaid covers 40% of births and 38% of children. It disproportionately enrolls individuals from racial and ethnic minority populations and other subgroups that have historically faced structural inequity in the United States, making it an important policy lever for addressing disparities in health care access, utilization, and health outcomes. Yet, health economics research on basic policy questions in Medicaid has largely lagged research in Medicare and commercial insurance markets.
