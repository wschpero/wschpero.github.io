In-depth study of Medicaid, the program that insures 93 million people with low income, has been compromised by a lack of data. Only comprehensive, high-quality claims data can provide the granular information on Medicaid enrolleesâ€™ characteristics, use of health care, and spending that are needed to inform sound policy decisions.

In 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System Analytic Files (TAF) in a bid to make Medicaid claims data from all states and territories available in a national repository. TAF provides researchers with higher-quality, more usable information about enrollees relative to previous datasets.

In 2022, we partnered with AcademyHealth to form the Medicaid Data Learning Network to provide a mechanism for TAF researchers to share best practices. That experience has identified three important opportunities for state and federal policymakers to improve TAF going forward.
