Enrollment in the Medicaid program has swelled to nearly 83 million people since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This growth —- an increase of approximately 17% -- has been attributed to new enrollment of those experiencing pandemic-induced job losses and the continuous coverage provisions of the federally declared Public Health Emergency (PHE), which prohibits state Medicaid agencies from terminating coverage for most beneficiaries. With the provisions set to expire, it is projected that millions of beneficiaries may lose their coverage as states resume regular redeterminations of eligibility. In the absence of proactive measures from states and the federal government, access to care may be compromised for a broad swath of the US population, potentially compounding inequities laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic.
