State and federal policymakers have articulated concerns about the budgetary implications of expanding Medicaid eligibility, arguing that investments in Medicaid could induce “benefit lock,” whereby recipients of Medicaid become dependent on the program and other forms of public assistance. In this study, we examine the long-run effect of receiving Medicaid as a child on the receipt of means-tested public assistance in adulthood. We conducted a regression discontinuity analysis, leveraging quasi-random exposure to increased Medicaid eligibility in childhood by birthdate. We found that the increase in Medicaid eligibility in childhood was not associated with significant changes in receipt of medical, cash, or non-cash public assistance in later life. At most, subgroups exposed to the greatest increases in Medicaid eligibility exhibited later life decreases in non-cash assistance of 2 to 3 percentage points.
