<p><b>I am a Ph.D. candidate studying <a href="http://publichealth.yale.edu/hpm/curriculum/phd/phd.aspx" target="_blank">health policy and economics</a> at Yale University.</b> I am also affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research, where I am currently a <a href="http://www.nber.org/programs/ag/cahr/training.html" target="_blank">Pre-Doctoral Fellow in Aging and Health Economics</a>.</p>

<p>My research is focused on evaluating — and optimizing — the design of the U.S. health care safety net, with the ultimate goal of informing the evolution of relevant federal and state policy, as well as the work of health care providers and organizations that serve vulnerable and high-need, high-cost patient populations. I have also studied the drivers of waste in the U.S. health care system and evaluated the effect of key provisions of the Affordable Care Act.</p>

<p>My work has appeared in a number of academic journals, including <i>Health Affairs</i>, <i>Health Services Research</i>, <i>JAMA</i>, and the <i>Journal of General Internal Medicine</i>. It has been featured by Bloomberg, CNBC, Politico, <i>The Washington Post</i>, and other news outlets.</p>

<p>Before coming to Yale, I completed a research fellowship at The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy & Clinical Practice, from which I also received a master’s degree. I received my undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College.</p>
