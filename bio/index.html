<p><h3><b>About Me</b></h3></p>

<p>I am a health economist and an assistant professor in the <a href="http://hpr.weill.cornell.edu/divisions/hpe/" target="_blank">Division of Health Policy and Economics</a> of the <a href="http://hpr.weill.cornell.edu" target="_blank">Department of Healthcare Policy and Research</a> at the Joan & Sanford I. Weill Medical College of Cornell University. I am affiliated with the <a href="https://cpc.cornell.edu" target="_blank">Cornell Population Center</a>, as well as Cornell's <a href="https://centerforhealthequity.cornell.edu" target="_blank">Center for Health Equity</a>, <a href="http://inequality.cornell.edu" target="_blank">Center for the Study of Inequality</a>, <a href="https://cpplresearch.org" target="_blank">Center for the Study of Physician Practice and Leadership</a>, and <a href="https://www.human.cornell.edu/pam/research/hehbad/home" target="_blank">Institute on Health Economics, Health Behaviors and Disparities</a>.</p>

<p>I study Medicaid and the health care safety net in the United States. Through my research, I aim to inform federal and state policy, as well as the work of health care providers and organizations that serve vulnerable and high-need, high-cost patient populations. I have also studied the drivers of waste in the U.S. health care system and analyzed the effect of key provisions of the Affordable Care Act.</p>

<p>My research has appeared in a number of academic journals, including <i>Health Affairs</i>, <i>Health Services Research</i>, <i>JAMA</i>, and the <i>Journal of General Internal Medicine</i>. It has been featured by Bloomberg, CNBC, Politico, <i>The Washington Post</i>, and other news outlets.</p>

<p>I received my Ph.D. in <a href="https://publichealth.yale.edu/hpm/curriculum/phd/phd.aspx" target="_blank">health policy and economics</a> from Yale University, during which I was also a pre-doctoral fellow in aging and health economics at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Before coming to Yale, I completed a master's degree and a research fellowship at The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy & Clinical Practice. I received my undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College.</p>
